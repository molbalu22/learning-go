# Grade an Exam

Write a small function that returns the numerical grade of an exam based on the percentage of points reached.

Use this table for grading:

| PERCENT                   | GRADE                  |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| 80+ | 5 |
| 60+ | 4 |
| 40+ | 3 |
| 20+ | 2 |
| otherwise                 | 0 |

For instance, the function should return 5 for a percentage of 100, and 0 for 0.

Insert your code into the file `exercise.go` near the placeholder `// INSERT YOUR CODE HERE`.

HINT: use the [`switch` statement](https://go.dev/tour/flowcontrol/9).
