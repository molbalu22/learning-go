# Concurrent Prime Number Generator
     
Implement the `GeneratePrimes` function that takes an integer `n` as input and returns a *sorted*
(in ascending order) slice of the prime numbers less than, or equal to `n`. Use goroutines and
channels to generate the prime numbers concurrently.

Hint: Use [`sort.Sort`](https://pkg.go.dev/sort#Sort) to sort integers.
