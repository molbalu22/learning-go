# Concurrent Word Count
     
Implement the `CountWords` function that takes a slice of strings as input and returns a map of
words and their respective counts. Use goroutines and channels to count the words concurrently.

Hint: You can use [`strings.Fields`](https://pkg.go.dev/strings#Fields) to split a string into
words flexibly.

Insert the code into the file `exercise.go` at the placeholder `// INSERT YOUR CODE HERE`.
