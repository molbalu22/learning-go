# Pointer basics

Write a function with the below signature that reads a pointer of type `*bool`and returns its value (of type `bool`).

``` go
func retrieveValue(pointer *bool) bool {
    // INSERT YOUR CODE HERE
}
```

Insert your code into the file `exercise.go` at the placeholder `// INSERT YOUR CODE HERE`.
